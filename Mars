Mars is the third planet from the sun.
It is named after the Roman god of War.
The planet gets its red color from the iron oxide that covers the 
surface.
Mars has two moons orbiting it, which is one more than the earth has. 
In the early 2000s, NASA, the American space program, sent a little 
robot to Mars that could gather information about the planet from its 
position on the ground and then transmit that information back to NASA's 
receivers on Earth. This bot was called the Mars Rover.
